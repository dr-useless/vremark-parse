## Lists

The following list **must** begin with the number 1:
1. Only lists that start with 1 are allowed to interrupt paragraphs.
1. Subsequent numbering is irrelevant.
0. You can start a new line with any number as long as you use the same delimiter character.
2) This item uses a different delimiter and starts a new ordered list, starting with the number 2.

This list can start with any number:

4) The empty line means that the list does not interrupt a paragraph.
1) The ordered list continues to increment the numbering from the previous list item.
5) Use any number fewer than ten characters. This number is parsed as the third item in the ordered list.

* Start unordered lists with -, *, or +.
+ You don't even have to use the same character for each list item.
- Pro tip: * and + require the Shift key. - doesn't. Format faster with the minus sign.
  * Nest unordered list items with two spaces.
    * Unordered lists support multiple levels of nesting.
